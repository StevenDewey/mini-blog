	<h2>My take on Richard's Bio:</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>Richard Pryor's biography, also known as "Pryor's Peoria" pushes the limits of traditional storytelling. The standard 600 page biography book has a common place and usage situation â€“ closed and sitting on a library shelf somewhere. With the immergence of new technology, the demographic willing to sift through 600 pages worth of material is dwindling. On the contrary, interesting information, craft-fully displayed has high utility and widespread interest in today's world.  "Pryor's Peoria" was recently named one of the top five digital history projects of 2014.</p><br><br>

		<p>Why you ask? The biography shows a comedic genius who struggled with the conventional schooling system in the 1950's, nevertheless acquired unconventional talents. At one point when he was 6 years old he was labeled as emotionally unstable, yet he was able to have such a powerful effect on American culture. The biography looks through the lens of his later success at his early adversity he faced that was, unfortunately, commonplace for young African Americans in the 1950's. </p><br><br>

		<p>Technically, the public facing biography brings together technology and history into a beautiful combination.  Scott Saul, the author, uncovered more than 200 documents, photos, audio tracks, newspaper clippings in his research. He combined all of these to make custom maps of the area Richard grew up in, noting the complicated block-by-block racial divisions. All of this rich content is artfully displayed on the website allowing for a unique digital companion to the traditional biography book by Saul. </p><br><br>

		<p>My verdict: "Pryor's Peoria" brings together the idea of big data, history, and web publishing to an insightful yet beautiful and engaging experience that pushes the limits of the traditional humanities experience. I loved feeling in control of my experience in the biography, if I got to a part that was not as interesting I could skim and click on a new topic that seemed interesting. </p>
