	<h2>My take on the Infinite Museum:</h2>
	<blockquote>
		<p>The Infinite Museum. Initial reaction: awesome idea, but not fully developed yet (hence the screenshot picture above showing what happens when you click on almost any link on the application. But why is the concept so cool? The motives behind the application is to help us connect with art in a new or better way. In the words of the creators "Art defines us and transforms us. It may be the most human thing we do. It sends us across time and space, connecting us to our past, to each other, to ourselves and to the infinite. Art museums, in a way, are laboratories for making these connections, mixing elements (art and people and ideas) together in unique alchemy - an alchemy of seeing".  The infinite museum is an attempt to create a new experience with art. The experience is meant to be both serious, educational, but also playful, introspective, and social. The experience is meant to facilitate the viewer with gaining their own meaning from the art experience. </p><br><br>

		<p>The infinite museum functions as a digital guided tour through a physical museum. The user carries the application in their hand and responds to the prompts the application gives them. The prompts are invitations to experience something new, to think something new, or to feel something new. Some of the prompts will lead the user to specific locations in the museum, others can be used anywhere in the museum. The creators say no preparation is required other than coming with a curious mind.  </p><br><br>

		<p>My verdict: I think the idea of an interactive museum that is humorous and educational is a phenomenal idea. I struggle to stay engaged when I attend art museums, but with a well done application like this I could really get into the experience. The main problem with this application as far as I can tell is it seems like it is still in beta and should not be in production just yet, almost every link I could click on went to a page that said that part of the site was coming soon. These links seemed to be critical functionality components to the idea. But overall I think something like this should be implemented in every museum nationwide. </p>
